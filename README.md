<h1 align="center"> Portfolio Project 1 </h1>



I got the idea for this project because I both draw and paint. I wanted to share art and create a possibility for other people to share their artwork as well.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Times Visitor, I want to quickly understand and learn what the site is about and the reason for its origin.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want the site to be easily understood as well as to clearly understand the site's layout.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to explore the content of the site and its functions and eventually further explore the creator's social media to learn more about them and the project.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if there are any newly added submissions.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to submit my my own artwork.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find social media links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to see newly submitted artwork.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to sign up to the website so I can get updates on the newly submitted content.

    -  ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colors I used in the project are in hex: 
            - #889682
            - #fff
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font for the logo is Vidaloka with a fallback of serif and the "<h2>" elements have the font Josefin Sans, fallback sans-serif and the remaining text is Abel, fallback font is sans-serif.
    -   #### Logotype
        -   The logotype, which is an amphora is a kind of vessel. The amphora was my initial association with the word and the word 'vessel' the function of the website in relationship to its content.

## Credits

### Code

-   I have taken inspiration from the Love Running project, which made me want to make a similar project but about art instead.

### Content

-   I got the ideas partly from myself because I wanted a place to be able to show my art but be able to expand that for other people to utilise as well.
-   I have used another student's readme.md file (with permission) as a template and wrote the content myself.

### Media

-   The images on the home page are private pictures of art I have created myself. The remaining art on the art page is from Pinterest.
-   The amphora with the text was created by me in Procreate to further emphasise my association of 'vessel' with the ancient Greek amphora.
